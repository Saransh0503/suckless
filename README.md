First git clone the repository from of dwm, dmenu and st from this repository by using the command

```
git clone https://github.com/Saransh0503/suckless.git 
```

after cloning the repository you just have to get into file named as suckless like for example I have a my suckless directory in home so,

```
cd suckless
```

now just use script install.sh for installing the files and extra dependencies for the dwm to start
use command 

```
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

make sure that u download these resources (suckless) in home directory for this command to work
